## TODO
- Get GSC access
- Get SemRush access
- Make like tom@activerecoverycompanions.com

## BACKLINK STRATEGIES
- long term maybe expired domains
- scholarship links
- rehab listing sites?
- 

## GENERAL
- first impressions is that there the link to page ratio is too low, either cull
pages (if content is not performing, ranking, or indexed and makes sense to
remove) and add more links
- can we no-index this and all future PPC pages (for crawl budget) ? https://getstarted.activerecoverycompanions.com/
- we need to do a sitewide content audit, and see what content is not
performing well then either make a decision to delete it or spruce it up
- review if there is a better way to orgnzie the content (ie post-sitemap)
- build email marketing list to push new content to everytime a blog post is
published
- let's write things that effectively helps people
- we need to build a more engaging experience in general, let's check other
rehab sites for examples to show Taylor

## Blog
- the blog is inauthentic and uninspiring,:WQ
- establish better visual style, kill all stock images
- maybe instead of all this kinda bland content we do annex the blog and do like
"Recovery Stories", we hold some type of monthly writing contest to get recovery
story submissions, then pay those people like some small prize, and republish
the story on our blog

- more inspiring stories, connect the audience to an inspiring story, one that
helps them take action...

- assign content to proper author:
https://activerecoverycompanions.com/author/recovery_admin/

- fix sp in url: https://activerecoverycompanions.com/estimonials/

- make better testimonial page, also use google ones, and add avatar photos even
if just from G

- location landing pages are quite thin, add content to a few of them and test effect https://activerecoverycompanions.com/miami-sober-companion/

- interested to see how well the content on the blog is performing, Josiah is
good writer, I'd like to see more focused pieces, consider publishing once a
month but making every article a banger; and then also we publish links to
article on all networks / accounts that make sense or that we have, think of how
we can write an article that might go viral on something like Reddit...

- stock images = bad, can we find a former drug addict artist to make a distinct
image style for us then use AI to replicate it for new images - find article
about this somewhere, this is because we want the stick in the memory of the
visitor, using stock images, they are not going to remember, doing something
more original, would be better here, we can also write a press release or maybe
not a PR but somehow incorporate this story of an addict that found his
sobrierty and is now this killer artist, these can even be small SVGs, pngs, etc

- I think in general if we are going to do a blog, do it for engaging reasons,
then add great internal linking to post for that SEO benefit.

- maybe some how connect our coaches to the writing? is that too ambitious?

-  blog sidebar or areas served?

## MENU 
- too many links, consider removing or making nested link system
- add scroll lock when open

## SITE WIDE
- add better internal linking between pages, consider some type of card
component at bottom

## BIO PAGES
- bio pages: https://activerecoverycompanions.com/meet-the-team/
- fix formatting on individual bio pages
- IMPORTANT: add internal links to bio pages, possilby to city, try to find a
way where it looks naturally
- consider building links from the people back to the pages
- consider adding internal links after content??, like From the blog, maybe
cities or something
- add call to action / button on this page, for example "Book Jhonny" or "Contact
Us"

## CITY PAGES
- add a footer style, inspired by mysobercompanions.com (with a unique
locational graphic)
- add a better internal linking strategy
- build at least one link to each city page
- Change this to actual landing page, ie should not be a blog post, https://activerecoverycompanions.com/florida-sober-companions/



- add component slices sections, one for like products / 3 info icons things
- add component for testimonial if we have these with images
- add component for FAQs (like 5 to 7 on pages that are thin and not
performing)
- areas served component to interlink between pages

- identify low performing city pages

Possibly too thin:
- https://activerecoverycompanions.com/miami-sober-companion/
- https://activerecoverycompanions.com/boston-sober-companions/

## FOOTER
- footer - change locations in footer to Areas Served, probably reduce these
alot as it's close to in the range of considering spam
- remove SM links... or link to proper locations, right now they just link to
like the domain...
