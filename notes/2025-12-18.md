Car crash nation like bumper cars in Paraguay.
And the weather is like the traffic, chaotic.
And charming colored humans everywhere.
Only place where I saw more traffic chaotic and dangerous
Was the #1 in Vietnam. In my mind it still is the #1 highway of death.

At times it feels like a nation adrift in an ocean even though it is land
locked. Like after an apocolyptic war or something. Except there are buffets
everywhere, and you'd assume because of all the buffets that it was an aging
population, but in fact, quite the opposite.
