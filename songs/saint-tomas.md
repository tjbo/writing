there’s nothing julia can do anymore,
she’s done like the day that’s hard to ignore
almost said something, but i’ll keep my tongue tied, 
over ther are her men from the shadowy side

they go back and forth arguing every single goddamn night
they got their problems i got mine too but you no this one here ain’t mine
