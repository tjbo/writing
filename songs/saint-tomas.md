there’s nothing julia can do anymore,
she’s done like the day that’s hard to ignore
almost said something, but I don't think you'd understand,
over there are the men, from the shadowy land



cause I saw it one night, and it changed my whole mind 



they go back and forth arguing every single goddamn night
they got their problems i got mine too but you no this one here ain’t mine


all the days they become nights
all the nights come like the days
and they all fade away,
oh my darling, oh I know...
