Car crash nation like bumper cars in Paraguay.

And the weather is like the traffic, chaotic.

The charming colored humans everywhere. 

But still put in place by the natural world, not like us moderns. 

No, not like us.

Us divorced and seperated from our natural instincts, cutoff from our true
natures.

And I never saw weather more violent and natural and forceful, then in Paraguay.

Like it would rain, and then a car would float past your window. It is quiet
dangerous in fact.

But to me I love paraguay, because nature is always doing these absurd things,
and you feel as if you are living next to the supra natural.

Maybe that is just how I feel in general and it is a subjective thing, but I
prefer it to living in a modern bourgeious way.

Well if I'm honest I prefer to live in the back of my friends apartment


And somehow that natural world it spills down from the divine and into their physces and makes them humble. 

Like many poorer nations, their collective unconscious seems more stable as
compared to the mass panic we'd see in richer nations during covid19.

Maybe because these huamns from richer nations *feel as if they have something to
lose.*

And that is maybe a lil' more of a disillusion that the natural born of the
poorer naitons do not have the luxury of clinging too.

But I think the latter situation might be the better situation, might lead to a
more natural and authentic life.

Whereas we are sure to see the new way of death being, "did I really just browse
tiktok my whole life?"

THe modern in this sense is ignorant to relality. 

To how violent and terrible history can be.

There have been far worse pandemics, wars, etc, in other eras than our modern
era, and this turns humans into weaker beings in many ways.

They don't touch or confront the super natural, in fact they actively try to
deny it's existence, they unconsciously deny their mortality.

But in poorer countries, it does not feel like that. The unconscious feels more
open, receptive, possibly funcitoning better than most people in a technocratic
state.

Precisley because they don't mingle withit.

These places are religous afterall and so they have a proper place for the
unconscious to be unconscious.

The moderns, they are robbed of their spirituality. It's why they search for it
in other countries and traditions. 

It's not a great situation, and not perfect to follow a tradition that does not
align with one's own collective, but it's a desperate situation.

Those moderns, are born into the most productive material civilization of all
time, but they are spiritually bankrupt. 

And the paraguayans are no different they have this peace of the unconscious
that the typical modern expat does not.  

But even with that peace, put them inside a car and they become maniacs. All of
them.

More like how humans were meant to be like if they had an instructional manual
for them  than the technocratic types of "modern" humans that seem to want to
change the planet into a large computer.

Only place where I saw more traffic chaotic and dangerous was when I drove the #1 in Vietnam on a 180cc honda bike. 

For my mind it will always be the real highway of death, even with just 180ccs.

Little yellow people crashing into each other, but it is a different type of
crashing and a different type of little.

It is a different type of oblviousness and every country on earth with humans
has it's oblviousnesses.

Every human has their oblviousness. 

I guess we are entitled to them. 

Not like that of the Colombians where you can't tell or not if they are just
actually really spiteful and hate all the gringos. 

At other times, charming, happy, gregarious. The most extroverted of nations
I've ever been to was Colombia, and so naturally it's not my favorite place, but
not without it's charms.

They can be very charming too. Helpful. Happy. 

Especially if they sense that you are not here to just party and take prostitutes.

I have an American friend who owns 30 airbnbs in Colombia. And he tells me
plenty of stories, and even tells me things I cannot speak about here, and even
does not tell me things that I know about but he cannot speak about it.

This one came into an Airbnb and is bringing hookers and cocaine and the middle
of the night, and the middle class colombian next door is an accountant who is
just trying to work in the morning!

And so they have to make new laws... this building can have short term rentals
and this one cannot.

I for one can't live in a coutnry like this wihtout very heavy daily use of
headphones with ANC, and living in a more modern building that is policed
properly and has sound bylaws, etc.

I've always loved peace and quiet, and if you read my airbnb reviews, you'd see
them all say "THis most be the most quietest man in existence".

Too me those damn colombians are so loud!

But when my degenerate brethen come from my home land, and keep the colombian
accountants up at night, I must confess I chuckle inside.  

Like, hah, I also live amongst people who are native to the country that also
cannot stand the chaos and noise.

I find happiness in the irony of it. 

Here we have possibly people from one of the loudest nad most extrovertided cultures in existence, and those are somehow
the crazy tourists they attact.


And oblvious.

There is a certain oblivousiness to Latin America in general, Asia less so. 

Asia is same same but different.

But the Paraguayans seem more like they are comfortable in oblvion.

Sometimes they even seem asian to me in the way that they are nice and friendly
and they are trying to create a peaceful soceity.

Not like the colombians. 

The colombians are more like the mexicans. 

Except the mexicans seem quieter and less chaotic, and more cultured with
brilliant things like their food and day of the dead. 

And the Panamanians aren't like any of them (at least they like to think that).
That physce is more isolated. Introverted. 

But not in a good way I think.

But the parguayans seem more natural like naturla humans in some way.

They have some kinda eurpean influence, but also that humble savage type thing
going.

I could see many Rousean types ending up in Paraguay. The romantic nomads...


At times it feels like a nation adrift in history like a little rafte in the ocean even though it is land
locked.

Except more comfortable with oblvioun than that.

It feels like a place like 100 years after a horrible apocolyptic war or something that has not quiet recovered but is doing it's best and doing well, and people are enjoying life and cooperating as best they can. 

And there are food buffets everywhere, and you'd assume because of all the buffets that it was an aging
population, but in fact, the popuplation leans more towards the young side.

And sometimes in the morning (far too often) I hear a sound in the distance of someone slamming
on car breaks, and then the car sliding across the pavement for 5 seconds, follwed by the invevitable sound
of shattering class and concrete and just in general the sounds that accompany nations full of bad drivers.

Thne the car alarm going off and dogs barking.

And someone told me there is a whole hospital ward somewhere in Asuncion full of almost formerly bad drivers. 

And everywhere you go in the country, each car is different, like only one of
them was importarted or like how Cuba has all those old cars from the 1950s.

And each car at least has one 13 dents in them. 

You couldn't count them all.

And everywhere you go is also like a different timezone. 

Like I went to this old Telecom building Copaco once by Mercado 4, because I couldn't figure out how to make a
long distance call on my iPhone without it costing $20 a minute with Tigo. 

And everything in the building was from the 1950s.

Thye had these glass phone booths you can go in, and a phone call costs far less
than Tigo. Copaco Cabinas. 

But another building down the street would make you feel like you were in the
1980s.

There are different timezones in this small country like every 2 blocks I feel
as if I'm in a different time zone.

Maybe that is why they all crash in their cars, they are in different timezones. 

Possibly a paraguayan was in the room when Enstein first said time and space are
not absolute, and in fact they are one thing called spacetime and it is all
relative.

Perhaps they took it to heart and this is why they all crash their cars into
each other, becuase they have no shared absolute time and space.

A nations of bad accidents all colliding into each
other.

But when they get out of their car. 

You expect them to be drunk, (and sometimes they are).

But they have this most unexpected quality of being the most charming people,
those Guaranis, something so humbel and still earnest in them.

And still not the violent creatures they seem to be if you only observe their driving
skills.
