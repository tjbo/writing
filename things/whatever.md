Oh well.

But I mad this computer just to run like a CLI program. Without any GUI. and
this could be the result. But how do we make it boot into this? Would it not be
easier with linux?

But now I have a type of word processor. We can maybe stand up for simple
software. Like a we have a right, these AI people are fucking nuts. And we have
a right to use software for humans. But now I have a simple machine. How do I
make one that is just NVIM?
