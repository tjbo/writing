I had a very simple dream, I was drinking with my cousin Jason. And it was
something like I didn't know if I had to go and buy beer, at some familiar place
like the University liqour store or something, but then I realized he had many
many beers. Myabe I checked the fridge or my wallet or something.

Not sure of what any of that means.
