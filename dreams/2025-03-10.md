Another flying dream last night. Except it was above the ocean. 

It started out I was down by this large inflatable boat, but maybe it was a submarine, and then taking off into the sky above that submarine type thing. 

The boat or sub was inflated with oxygen and thats how the people could breathe. It was a large boat with like long wings perpendicular to the body of the boat.

Sort of out in front of it anticipating it's direction.

I thought that maybe this is what I could do, I could be the lookout for the boat but now I was was flying around really, really high. 


There was another dream last week where everyone was hovering around in the sky, like maybe 10 metres from the ground, not really flying, but hovering like a religious thing and there was a large group of people all doing it. 

But i was hovering more away from them. And it was not above water but maybe at like a church or something. And it made me think of this episode of Johnathon Bi where he talks about people hovering with this like religoius documentor or something.
