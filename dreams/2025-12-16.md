This night I had a dream, and I remember things from it. Like I was under the
water, deep in the sea. And I was going down into the deep to search for someone
or something. And maybe I was lost or something. But I saw, okay I saw... a LEGO
person.

I wish I had a drawing of him, but he looked like kinda of a cross between a
character from yellow submarine, and a man built from logo. I call him LEGO MAN.
I think he was a helpful character, and I'm not sure what he was doing. But he
kind of was like a fish, I think he might be an important character in my
unconscious. 


I then had another dream where I was playing music. And I can't remember much
more other than that, because of course it was the other night.
