How To Philosophize With a Kitchen Blender

Does a kitchen blender fundamentally make life better?

That is the philosophical question I pose to us moderns. 

With our things and our stuff that make the things and stuff go faster.

This may seem like a rather strange question on the surface, however it's a question we need to ask ourselves; especially when bringing a new productized item into our lives.

How will this item make me better as a human? How will this item make my life better?

We need to ask this question because there is so much cruft and junk in our lives that clouds our reality as humans. 

Much of it is distracting.

There is not one answer to such a question, as a kitchen blender can mean something entirely different to different types of people.  For example if you are a chef, a kitchen blender might be indespenisble.

But I ask this question in terms of the average joe general consumer, and it's from this perspetive that I approach this deep philosophical question.

If we look on the pro side of this the fundamental thing it does is change our sensory experience of food; perhaps we think we are more likely to eat fruit if we use such a thing as a fruit blender.

But one could argue, it does the complete opposite. That in fact eating whole fruit is much better than eating processed fruit. For example, whole fruit has fiber and the process of breaking down fiber we all now is good for our physical health.  Humans have eaten fruit for eons without kitchen blenders.

It is the natural work of the stomach to break down the fruit.

And in this sense the blender is a 

The blender on the other hand destroys the food into a less food like substance.

However, the kitchen blender obliterates the food!

A stomach for example is much healthier with fiber, and with the process of consuming the banana whole as opposed to not whole.

Most occidentale lives are lived like within a giant marketing scheme.	

New fully formed whole suburban developements are really like unhistorical giant marketing schemes.

There is something about a place being "new" that appeals to a certain type of consciousness.




In our western consciousness our mind-body dualism prevades our view that we are fundamentally seperate from the world.

One part of us is a soul, one part of us is a body.

Even if this were true (or provable); our physical existence at times demands almost the opposite. 

For us to act as physical beings.
 We are not seperate from our biology. 

Yes I think it is fairly obvious that most humans are a multiplicity of identities and forces.

However, we are still embodied in a biological body.

It's almost guraanteed in the future that humans will modify their bodies, will fuck with evolution.

The Occidentale experience is a athesitic dis-embodiement. 

Most Westerners either consciously or unconsciouly only find a sort of transcendant experience in their becomingingness. Not their beingness.

And in the consumerist world this means that you are seperated from your best Self through the purchasing of products.

The very act of purchasing something is often a negation of life. A negation of your best self.

Only you can be a judge of this, I mean perhaps someone that knows you very well can be helpful in this regard, but finally it is left to you.

Like in a certain situation the purchase of a musical instrument and can be very life and strength affirming.

The problem with a too productized culture, is that you do not have the experience, the suffering of the self, to understand what the self needs.

A human being is stuck, in this beingness. However the way out of this nihlisitic beingness is not to buy more things, but to buy the exact right things for your life as a human life as an individual.

Two important questions to ask in this way is:

1 - Does buying this product help me in my human becomingness, is it useful towards my ultimate goal?

2 - d

This is more or less a fairly infantile view of reality.

You are not good enough as you are!

You will only be made better through the purchasing of material items.

This is actually the trick of most advertising. If you view advertising from a more rational viewpoint, most of it eventually becomes absurd.
It's easier to see this absurdism when you are outside your birth culture, and in a forgien land. 

IN a forgien land, the majority of advertisements appear as absurdities where as in your homeland you are somehow under their spell.

I often wonder how it would be to go back to Canada, what perception of the that nation would I have of it? 

As someone who has been outside of that country for something like 10 of the last 15, there are things about that culture that just appear absurd to me.

But this is a fundamentally absurd view of life.

If only you buy this thing will you be made better.

In fact, an aspect of sales that is really interesting, is that they try to sale you on the thing you are missing.

For example, many car commercials will be set in pristine mother nature, however it is not mother nature they are trying to sell you, it is the vehicle going through mother nature.

Is it your trimuph over nature!? Is it the beauty of nature? Or does it in some ways represent freedom?

Have you ever seen a car commercial about the car being stuck in traffic in a concrete jungle?

The car commericial is always shot outside of the city in the country side, where the vast majority of us usually are.

The car commercial in some sense is the meta-physical "true world".

Our world like the christian world, is not good enough, we cannot affirm it enough, and so we need a metaphysical "neo-platonic true world".

Nietzche called this the largest error in all of western civiliazation of plato.

He also said maybe it is what made us who we were with teh bow stretching tight.

But whereever you look whether for a ford truck or a God, there does seem to be this metaphysical need of humans.

Animals do not seem to have it?!?




Most things that you ultimately value will be "tools" that you use daily to acceratel in your human becomingness.


In this sense I thnik there are alot of parrelles betweeen religous belief and consumerism belief.

Consumerism is really neo-platonic in that there is 1 true world where you have the item of your fancy and you are made better by the ownership of this item.

Nietzche would suggest that this is the wrong way to but your mind body towards. That 


I think in a sense this gives us a version of true world theory. That works.

At the basis of western thought is something called True World Theory.



Plato claimed that each individual has an immortal soul, which was their true self, and the goal of life was to liberate this soul from the confines of the body and have it enter the true world, which he called the reality of Forms.

Like consumerism is true world theory.


most modern kitchens contain too many things, so many things that we almost need a principle to moderate things which we should own.

the average modern person is very rich in material posessions, especially in comparison to ancient times. 

but often lacking in any type of physcological development. 

They often have so many possessions in their lives that they can only be said to be suffering from a disease of the excess.

IN a relgious context we can refer to this as “glutony”.

And glutony in general throughout the world’s religions and philosophies is generally agreed to be a terrible thing.

The kitchen blender to me represents the worst things about contemporary society.

IT's very creation is the symptoms of a glutonous society.


The kitchen blender on it’s surface seems fun, and from the people that I have questioned on that matter they always say one thing

You can make smoothies with it!

This is interesting of course, because smoothies are mostly a way to make food worse a food than it naturally occurs.

A smoothies robs the body of it’s natural effort in breaking down food and it’s fiber. It also spikes the surgars of a body far more much that i needs to.

Some would say that something like a kitchen blender makes life more pleasurable and efficient, but even this conclusion is incorrect; for eating many smoothies you are more likely to become diabetic and have health problems/

But by it’s very measure a kitchen blender requires electricity, assembly and disassembly.

Some fruits; like a banana only require the removal of the peel.


A brief history of Mind-Body Dualism

Nietzsche rejected the traditional mind-body dualism that characterized much of Western philosophy. He believed that the mind and body were not separate entities, but rather parts of a single, unified whole.
Nietzsche argued that the mind and body were not two distinct substances, but rather different expressions of the same underlying force or energy. He saw the mind as a product of the body, rather than as a separate entity that controlled the body. Nietzsche believed that the mind was deeply rooted in the physical body, and that our thoughts, feelings, and perceptions were all influenced by our bodily experiences and instincts.
In Nietzsche's view, the idea of a separate, disembodied mind was a product of an outdated and misguided metaphysics. 

He saw the mind and body as inseparable aspects of a single, dynamic organism that was constantly changing and evolving in response to its environment. Nietzsche emphasized the importance of the body and its instincts in shaping our experience of the world and our place within it, and he believed that true self-understanding could only be achieved by embracing our embodied existence.

␌In Eastern philosophy, the view of mind-body dualism is quite different from the traditional Western perspective. Eastern philosophies such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism, emphasize the interconnectedness of the mind, body, and spirit, and see them as an integrated whole.
In Hinduism, the concept of the "Atman" or the individual soul, is seen as being intimately connected to the "Brahman," the universal soul or cosmic consciousness. This view sees the mind and body as two aspects of the same underlying reality, and that the ultimate goal of life is to realize this unity and transcend the limitations of the physical body.
Similarly, in Buddhism, the concept of "anatta" or "non-self" rejects the idea of a separate, enduring self or soul. Instead, the mind and body are seen as being constantly changing and interdependent, with the mind arising from the body and vice versa. The ultimate goal of Buddhist practice is to see through the illusion of a separate self and recognize the interconnectedness of all things.
In Taoism, the concept of "Qi" or vital energy, is seen as flowing through all things, including the mind and body. The practice of Taoist meditation and other spiritual practices aim to harmonize the mind and body with the natural flow of Qi, leading to greater health and well-being.
Overall, Eastern philosophy emphasizes the interdependence and interconnectedness of the mind, body, and spirit, and sees them as integral aspects of a larger whole. This view rejects the idea of a separate, enduring soul or self and focuses on the integration of all aspects of human experience.
