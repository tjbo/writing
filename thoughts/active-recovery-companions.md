- re-brand, hire a local web designer - I think there is broad concensus on
this, I'm not myself a designer... and in this case I think he needs someone
better
- site audit - audit every page, trim down un-indexed pages, and content that
doesnt make sense, make sure to remove broken pages and that redirects are where
they make sense
- I'm not sure blog posts are moving the needle at all... is there a more
natural content strategy? for example, like former addict stories? like a
contest or something?
- we need better linking and content strategies
- move the site to a better publishing system
- organic traffic stats are more abysmall then I thought... o
- corrective measures; we need high quality links, nothing below DA 40,
preferably above DA 50 to 60, do not use just 1 linking stratgey, in fact, if
all we've done is earned media, we need to not do earned media and balance those
with a more diverse range of links
- google business profile - make sure to check areas served
- PPC, orginally I thought, $500 would double the traffic, but in fact ARC has
very little rankings and traffic pertaining exactly to the more bottom of funnel
keywords, I think do a 6 month campaign at $500.00 to $1000.00, geo targeted in
rich neighborhoods... around LA? or what does Taylor think?
- we need the site to trend in the opposite direction...
