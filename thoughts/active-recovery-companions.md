- re-brand, hire a local web designer - I think there is broad concensus on
this, I'm not myself a designer... and in this case I think he needs someone
better
- site audit - audit every page, trim down un-indexed pages, and content that
doesnt make sense, make sure to remove broken pages and that redirects are where
they make sense
- I'm not sure blog posts are moving the needle at all... is there a more
natural content strategy? for example, like former addict stories? like a
contest or something?
- we need better linking and content strategies
- move the site to a better publishing system
- organic traffic stats are more abysmall then I thought... o
- corrective measures; we need high quality links, nothing below DA 40,
preferably above DA 50 to 60, do not use just 1 linking stratgey, in fact, if
all we've done is earned media, we need to not do earned media and balance those
with a more diverse range of links
- google business profile - make sure to check areas served
- PPC, orginally I thought, $500 would double the traffic, but in fact ARC has
very little rankings and traffic pertaining exactly to the more bottom of funnel
keywords, I think do a 6 month campaign at $500.00 to $1000.00, geo targeted in
rich neighborhoods... around LA? or what does Taylor think?
- we need the site to trend in the opposite direction... 

- make plan
- make current benchmarks

CURRENT PROBLEM: Not enough phone calls

GOAL: Increase qualified leads (via phone, email and calendar bookings on
website)

WHY DOES PROBLEM EXIST?
- inexperience and bad strategic decisions 

METHOD TO SOLVE PROBLEM:
- improve search marketing (PPC & Organic), this means managing all aspects of
these things

TIMELINE:
- increase leads over the next 3 months by ramping up PPC, PPC requires
continaula optimizaion and maintainance as it is ongoing
- increase leads over the long term using organic SEO, 6 months to 1 year

RISKS:
- usual SEO risks, in that we don't know how Google might change going forward
- we mitigte this risk by logging every *traceable action* we take that might effect our results, constnatly analysiy and monitoring who has the tops spots and in what ways do their sites differ from ours
- we migtigat this risk by building a more divversified backlink profile
- we migitate this risk by following industry guidelines, and also verifying
that industry guildines are
- we mitigate this risk by having many sites in the game

- risks of current site have some shoddy SEO in the past that is likely
effecting it's authority, we mitgate the effects
of this through lower risk actions and tactics until we rebuild some of our lost
trust with google
- we mitigate this risk by having "perfect onsite SEO"

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- in 2026 we hope to bring ARC at least 5 more contracts

Ongoing:
- at least 1 mid to high quality link a week, at least DA30+, with at least one
DA50+ backlink a month

Month 1
a - move site off current system
b - system is unreliable and can't be trusted that it is functioning correctly
c - in the process of moving this site we will audit every page for proper SEO practices and if it is adding value (there are unesacary and broken pages)
d - when we move to new system we will have a system that has perfedt on page
technical SEO
e - prune any content not deemed worthy, that is ineffective, and make note of
any content that needs to be updated, re-written or deleted

Migration accomplishes a few things
- no guessing if site is functional when publishing and managing existing
content
- we are going to audit every inch of the site so that we have 0 technical SEO
problems, and remove content or pages that are not providing value to our SEO
efforts
- 100% site audit score in sem RUSH, 100% page speed score in pagespeed insights

Month 2
a - start building PPC landing page
